WHAT IS CICOIN?

CiCoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of CiCoins are carried out collectively by the network. CiCoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls CiCoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, CiCoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.

Q: How do I know there isn't a virus in the file? 
A: We inspect our binaries before upload, and also upload a copy to VirusTotal.

Q: Can I build my own wallet from source? Do you use Gitian? 
A: We will soon release the official source tree for all users who wish to custom compile our source. Our official builds are all built using Gitian which will allow users to verify the source matches the compiled binary. Gitian uses a deterministic build process which creates identical binaries.
